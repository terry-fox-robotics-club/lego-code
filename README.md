# LEGO Code
The repository that holds templates and random snippets for those working with LEGO in TFRC.

## Editing files
Most of the files in this repo are *not* text files.  To edit them you need the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Software, which you can download for Windows and OS X [here](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/download-software).  Sorry Linux users, there isn't a version available for you.  Unfortunately, there also isn't much reference material for this software.  Some of the limited material that can be found is found [here](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/learn-to-program).
